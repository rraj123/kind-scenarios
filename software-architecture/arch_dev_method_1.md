## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
### 1.2 Scope
#### Included Topics
#### Excluded Topics
<i> Analyze the initial statements and come up with a high level context diagram. This step sets the foundation for the next steps such as DDD / Use case steps </i>

## 2. Architectural Representation
### 2.1 Context View 
<i>High-level view how your system would interface with external and internal components. This diagram will not address all the details, however, this would highlights at subsystems level and actors (external systems). </i>

<i> When / How do you address architecture principles, style, characteristics. Through the business drivers, identify the NFRs, characteristics and decide what kind of style that you would need to address the business problems. From Context view, High-light the significant usecase and data flow from the business drivers. </i>

### 2.2 Architecture Goals and constraints
### 2.3 Data Reuse - Address Data parts
### 2.4 Architecture Characteristics. 

<br>
Step 2 & 3 are iterative and feed information to each other.  
<br>

## 3. Usecase  <br>
Similar to Context diagram, How users will interact with the systems. (Actor / Actions Model)

### Address - Security concerns. 

### DDD Context Map 

### DDD - Bounded context to Microservices mapping

### API - Each Interactions <br> [ Event storming sessions]
To be captured and address the concerns and apply architectural qualities. (DDD - Principles)

### API - DDD - Subsystem - Event storming  <br>
<i> Messaging </i>
<i> Address the architeture style here. Lets say that you have microservice style architecture, Address the systems view at microservice standpoint and interactions within and external  </i>

### Microservice and EDA View 

### Deployment View 
### Data platform View. 

### Architecture FIT Functions (Evolutionary) 


### 4. ADR 
<i>From Step and 2 and 3, Capture the ADRs. (Format to be decided)</i>

#### 4.1 Introduction
#### 4.2 Decision
#### 4.3 Rationale
#### 4.4 Status
#### 4.5 Consequences
