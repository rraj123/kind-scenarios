### Defining Software Architecture <br>

Software architeture consists of the struture of the system, combined with with an architecture characteristics. 

`what is analyzed when an architect analyzes an architecture` <br>
All the characteristics  <br>

Software architeture consists of the struture of the system, combined with with an architecture characteristics. 
<br>
```
Software Architecture = Structure of the system + Architecture Characteristics
* system must support decisions, Design principles 

System Structure = Type of architecture style. 
```

The system must support, `architecture decisions` and finally `design principles.`

What is structure of the system refers to the type of `architecture style` the system implemented (microservice, micro kernal and etc)

<br>
Architecture characteristics are so important 
<br>
Notice that all of the characteristics listed do not require knowledge of the functionality of the system, yet they are required in order for the system to function properly. Architecture characteristics are so important 
<br>

Architecture decisions define the rules for how a system should be constructed.

<br>
The next factor that defines software architecture is architecture decisions. Architecture decisions define the rules for how a system should be constructed.
<br>

<br>
If a particular architecture decision cannot be implemented in one part of the system due to some condition or other constraint, that decision (or rule) can be broken through something called a variance.
<br>



`A design principle differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule.`

<br>

Architecture decisions form the constraints of the system and direct the development teams on what is and what isnâ€™t allowed.

<br>


Core Characteristics <br>
```
Make architecture decisions
Continually analyze the architecture
Keep current with latest trends
Ensure compliance with decisions
Diverse exposure and experience
Have business domain knowledge
Possess interpersonal skills
Understand and navigate politics
```

#### Make Architecture Decisions

`An architect is expected to define the architecture decisions and design principles used to guide technology decisions within the team, the department, or across the enterprise.`

Now, Say it simple word what is architecture decisions 
what is design principles
